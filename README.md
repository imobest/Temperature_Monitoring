# Temperature monitoring 
School project with PHP and Arduino (early 2020)
Arduino + Ethernet shield temperature monitoring 
# Project 
The aim of the project was to program the Arduino together with the Ethernet Shield to send data from temperature sensors (DS18B20) to the database, and then display it on the 
website with graphs. Additionally, there is a login system. After logging in to the website, we can view the last 10 measurements and see the sensor addresses, 
update date, graph with a legend.
